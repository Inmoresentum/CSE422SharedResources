# CSE422 Fall 2022 Lab(s)

This repository contains CSE422 Lab Assignment(s) solutions in **_Java_** and **_Python_**.

## System Requirements

To test and run the application, or if you want to modify things according to your needs

you will have to install the following things.

1. Java

   `jdk` version **18.0.2** or higher. Download [jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) if you don't
   have it already.
   
   If you are on `unix` like system, you can use [SDK MAN](https://sdkman.io/) 
   which has certain advantages over other methods.
   
   To check your version of java, run:

   ```shell
    java --version
   ```
   To check `javac` version run the following command.
   ```shell
    javac --version
   ```

2. Python

   `python` version **3.10.8** or higher.
   Download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it
   already.

   To check your version of python, run:

   ```shell
    python --version
   ```
   - **Note**: Unix like operating systems (`OS X, Linux and BSD`) `python` comes with the operating system itself.
     So, I recommend using any _**virtual environment**_ instead of using the _**system environment**_ which can break
     things easily.
     You can
     use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
     or any other environment of your choice.

## Setup

To set up, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   Make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. To check run `git --version` in your
   terminal.
   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Inmoresentum/CSE422SharedResources
   ```

2. Change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd CSE422SharedResources
    ```
   Or open this directory with your favourite **code editor** or **IDE**!

## Issues

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation? You can help
by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Inmoresentum/CSE422SharedResources/issues). Before you create an
issue, make sure to search for the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.
